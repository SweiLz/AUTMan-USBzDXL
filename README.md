USBzDXL, RS485 and Half-Duplex TTL connection to USB
============================

   The USBzDXL is a device used to directly drive the dynamixel on a PC. The USBzDXL is used by connecting to a USB port of a PC, and is equipped with 3pin and 4pin connectors to be connected with a variety of dynamixels. Both of 4pin (RS485) and 3Pin (TTL Half-Duplex) can be used in same time without changing Switch. 
In addition, the USBzDXL can be used to transform a USB port into a serial port for a PC without a serial port such as a lap-top computer. This function can be used effectively when dynamixel exclusive controllers such as the CM-2, CM-2+ and CM-5 are connected to an UBS port or when the ZIG2Serial is connected to an USB port to control a robot by radio.
